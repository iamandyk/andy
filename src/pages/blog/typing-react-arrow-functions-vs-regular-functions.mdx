# Typing React Arrow Functions Vs Regular Functions

It took me awhile to finally grok why you can't type regular function components
quite the same way as arrow function components. The answer is actually simple:
you can't currently apply a type to a function declaration in Typescript. There
is currently an open issue for this
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/22063).

A lot of tutorials make use of arrow functions coupled with the
`React.FunctionComponent` type or `React.FC` for short.

```jsx
import React from "react"

type UserHeaderProps = {
  name: string,
  username: string,
}

const UserHeader: React.FC<UserHeaderProps> = ({ name, username }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{name}</h2>
    <h5>{username}</h5>
  </div>
)

export default UserHeader
```

If you were to define the same component using a function declaration you would
quickly realize that there is no way to apply the `React.FC` type and so you
will have to settle for just being able to type your parameters and the return
type of your component.

```jsx
import React from "react"

type UserHeaderProps = {
  name: string,
  username: string,
}

function UserHeader({ name, username }: UserHeaderProps): React.ReactElement {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <h5>{username}</h5>
    </div>
  )
}

export default UserHeader
```

If you still want to define your React component as a regular function and
utilize the `React.FC` type you will have to take the extra step of capturing
your function in a variable.

```jsx
import React from "react"

type UserHeaderProps = {
  name: string,
  username: string,
}

const UserHeader: React.FC<UserHeaderProps> = function({ name, username }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <h5>{username}</h5>
    </div>
  )
}

export default UserHeader
```
