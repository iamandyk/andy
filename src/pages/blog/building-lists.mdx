Do you remember The List App? You know, the one created by Ryan (BJ Novak) from
The Office? It let you make lists about anything and share them publicly.
Simple, fun, and surprisingly unique to the internet. Which is wierd because the
internet
[loves](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-the-internet-loves-lists-1115/)
[lists](https://buzzfeed.com). So it was a bit sad ðŸ˜¢ when they shut down The
List App ([li.st](https://li.st)) which seemed to be our only way to make and
share lists of

the internet.

Until today! That's right. I'm going to make an open source list making app and
document the whole process here.
